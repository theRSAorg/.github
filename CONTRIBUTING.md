# Contributing to the RSA's repositories

We're so thankful that you are interested in contributing to our repositories :sparkles::sunflower:

## Getting started: issues
You can suggest ideas for enhancement or report problems using *issues*.

If your idea relates to our GitHub organisation as a whole, use the issues in the `.github` repository.
If you idea relates to a specific repository, then please use the issues in that repository.
Before submitting a new issue, please check if one already exists by searching through the open issues in the relevant repository.

If what you have identified does not already exist as an issue, then please submit a new one!
We have two issue templates that you can choose from:
- **General**: for any idea that you have that could improve our work
- **Reproducibility problem**: for when you aren't able to reproduce some of our work

One of our maintainers will respond to your issue as soon as possible.

## Making changes with Pull Requests
Once a maintainer has been in touch about an issue you submitted, they may ask for your help with solving the issue.
This is entirely __*voluntary*__; do not feel obliged if you do not have the time or interest.

If you are happy to contribute code, please follow this process:
1. Make a fork of the repository to your own account
2. Create a new branch, with a name that reflect the work that you are doing
3. Make small, easy-to-describe commits
4. When you are happy with the work, submit a Pull Request. Please add as much information as possible in the Pull Request and make sure to mention the issue to which the Pull Request relates. [Read more about linking Pull Requests to Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
5. One of the maintainers will review your Pull Request and with either accept it or ask for changes.
6. Once your Pull Request has been accepted, one of our maintainers will merge it ðŸš€
